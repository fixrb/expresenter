module Expresenter
  # Class responsible for handling and reporting successful test expectations.
  #
  # The Pass class represents test results that didn't fail, but can be in different states:
  # - Success: Test passed completely as expected
  # - Warning: Test passed but with some concerns (typically for :SHOULD or :MAY requirements)
  # - Info: Test passed but with additional information to note
  #
  # Each state has its own character indicator, emoji, and color for easy visual identification
  # in test output:
  # - Success: "." (green) ‚úÖ
  # - Warning: "W" (yellow) ‚ö†Ô∏è
  # - Info: "I" (blue) üí°
  #
  # @example Creating a successful test result
  #   result = Expresenter::Pass.new(
  #     actual: "foo",
  #     definition: 'eq "foo"',
  #     error: nil,
  #     got: true,
  #     negate: false,
  #     level: :MUST
  #   )
  #   result.success?   # => true
  #   result.warning?   # => false
  #   result.info?      # => false
  #   result.to_sym    # => :success
  #   result.char      # => "."
  #   result.emoji     # => "‚úÖ"
  #   result.to_s      # => "Success: expected \"foo\" to eq \"foo\"."
  #
  # @example Creating a warning result
  #   result = Expresenter::Pass.new(
  #     actual: "foo",
  #     definition: 'eq "foo"',
  #     error: nil,
  #     got: false,  # Warning state is triggered when got: false
  #     negate: false,
  #     level: :SHOULD
  #   )
  #   result.warning?   # => true
  #   result.to_sym    # => :warning
